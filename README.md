Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVClHLwv-4I&feature=youtu.be
Face API:https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js

- change the function, so that the camera becomes invisible for the tracked person
- change the output from the text field neutral, happy and so on to an animation
- delete the output neutral, if this is possible
